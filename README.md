Overview:
This project is a graphical game developed for a CSC 130 course. It involves player movement, collision detection, and interaction with various game elements.

Project Highlights:

Interactive Gameplay: Engage in an immersive game experience with character movement and interactions within a graphical environment.
Player Movement: Move the character in four directions (up, down, left, right) with smooth and responsive controls.
Collision Detection: Accurate detection of collisions with game objects and boundaries to ensure realistic movement.
Character Interactions: Interact with different game elements like a rose and a chicken, with specific messages displayed for each interaction.

Key Features:

Coordinates and Bounding Boxes: Manage player positions and detect collisions using coordinates and bounding boxes.
Directional Movement: Update player coordinates based on the direction of movement, ensuring precise control.
Collision Checks: Prevent the player from moving into areas that would result in a collision.
Interaction Messages: Display appropriate messages when the player is near specific objects, enhancing the game's narrative.
This project was an excellent opportunity to develop skills in game development, graphical programming, and handling complex interactions in Java.
